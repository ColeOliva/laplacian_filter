y'know the gist by now. compile using ```gcc edge_detector.c``` (figured out how to use code blocks in .md files woo!! thanks google). run using ```./a.out _ppmfilename_``` (example: ```./a.out cayuga_1.ppm```).
if you want to run the script, say, on the photos directory, run ```./run_program.sh ./photos```.
